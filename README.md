how common is it for restaurants to serve food not prepared from scratch in their own kitchens? Is it possible that a restaurant with a small kitchen and kitchen staff can prepare from scratch 15 appetizers and 30 entrees, many of the entrees with their own special sauces and accompaniments? How common is it to purchase prepared food and finish it in the kitchen?

it happens; probably in most chain restaurants where they get their food from a centralized kitchen and they only do the re-heating and plating.

That is why it's really hard to be a successul restaurant chef/owner, there is a lot of preparation (mise en place) needed for a night at the restaurant, all the cooks prepare the food (that can be made in advance) during the day, so that in the evening they only have to cook what needs to be cooked fresh.
